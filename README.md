# DockerHub_Learn_Codebase
This repo is where i will be putting my codebase of my DockerImage for start.


### simple_node is my first container on DockerHub

### slow-node has codebase for docker images through Base Image
The base image directory in it contains the Dockerfile for base Image which consist of all the dependencies of NodejS packed into a container required to run slow-node image. 
This is the link to the corresponding [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/darkphoenix17/slow-node) Image.
